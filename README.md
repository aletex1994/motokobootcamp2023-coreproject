# MOTOKO BOOTCAMP 2023 Core project üßë‚Äçüî¨
## ‚ùì **What is the core project**
The core project is a project that you will build during the entire week. 
The experience of building this project will be as close as possible as what the experience of building a real-live project on the Internet Computer looks like. 

## ü§î **Motivation** 
The Bootcamp is not a hackathon and should not be approached as a competitive event. Its primary purpose is to bring the community together in a shared effort to promote the Internet Computer, Motoko, and train a new generation of developers.

With that in mind, having to work in autonomy on a complete & real project with different requirements will provide the students & the Bootcamp with the following benefits: 
- It helps reinforce the knowledge and skills acquired through lectures and daily challenges.
- It provides a clear and motivating end goal for the Bootcamp.
- It challenges the autonomy and creativity of each student.
- It gives beginner students a taste of what it's like to be a developer and work on a project.
- It allows for prizes to be awarded to the most deserving students.
- It creates a live project that showcases the Motoko Bootcamp community and its achievements.
